# Code blocks...

### (Fenced) Code Blocks == Plain code blocks

```

```



``````

``````



``````
I just made a blank box (similar to a text box)--need 6 back ticks ` or you can use tildas ~
``````

### Code span // non "pre-formatted code block"? == In line blocks

`printf()`

`maybe?`

`insert text between backtick quotes`

```function test() {console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");}```



### R code block

```R

```

** this is coded for R* language specific



# LaTeX equation fun

### In line LaTeX equation

$$ z_{n+1}= z*n^2 + c $$

### Centered LaTeX equation

$$
z_{n+1}= z*n^2 + c
$$



# Horizontal rule

# Diagrams! 

** This is in Mermaid*

We ran through some examples together in class

```mermaid
graph TD
	Start --> Stop 
```



```mermaid
graph LR
	A(Start) ==> Stop 
```

Ok, now my attempt:

	Before:

	After: 

```mermaid
graph TB
	A(Collect) --> B(Clean) 
	B --> |One| C[Compare sequences]
	B --> |Two| D[Phylogenetic analysis] 
```
